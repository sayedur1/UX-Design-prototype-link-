https://invis.io/PEWFW6DC29R     (prototype link of "persuasive design of near home tourism").
Travelers go to long distance traveling more compared to short distance traveling which in-
creases carbon dioxide emission. Carbon dioxide emission has detrimental effect on environ-
ment. i have decided to persuade the travelers towards Near Home Tourism by designing a
persuasive web service. The aim of my thesis on figuring out the obstacles and requirements of
the travelers and designing a persuasive website for Near Home Tourism so that travelers grow
their interest towards Near Home Tourism instead of distance traveling.This application will suggest tourist places to the users based on their present location. 
from this application the users can buy ticket,book hotels(if needed) to go the destination. from this application users can do all traveling related activities.
